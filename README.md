# learn_python

**Recording my own progress, one file at a time.**

This repository is a chronological learning log of my Python journey. Each file/folder represents exercises, notes, and practice from different learning sessions. It’s not a finished project or polished library, it's my learning process, recorded.

## What this repo *actually* is

This is:
- code I wrote to learn and experiment with Python syntax and concepts
- work organized by session or topic
- a practice & progress tracker, not production code
- small console programs

This is **not**:
- a framework, package, or installable Python project
- complete tutorials
- guaranteed clean or consistent code
